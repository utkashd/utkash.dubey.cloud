                In 2021, it is well-established that Avatar: The Last Airbender
                is nothing short of a masterpiece.

                ATLA is set in a pre-industrial world where some people are born
                with the ability to control one of the four elements: water,
                earth, fire, or air. The act of controlling an element is called
                bending, and a person doing the bending is called a bender.
                Mirroring the four elements, there are four nations, the Earth
                Kingdom, the Fire Nation, the Water Tribe, and the Air Nomads,
                and conflict ensues when the Fire Nation attacks and invades the
                other three nations. The Avatar, the one person able to bend all
                four elements, and the one whose de facto responsibility is to
                ensure peace and balance in the world, has been missing,
                allowing the Fire Nation to continue their conquest and
                aggression for nearly 100 years. ATLA follows the new Avatar, a
                12-year-old Air Nomad monk named Aang, in his quest to master
                all four elements and end the war.

            <p>
                ATLA checks all the boxes of a basic cartoonâ€”its animation
                style, goofball humor, and adventurous, fantastical plot are
                designed to appeal to the audience of its network, Nickelodeon.
                But ATLA accomplishes much more than that. Through high-quality
                storytelling, ATLA develops its characters and shows us their
                maturations. Through its animation, soundtrack, and pacing, it
                instills a love for nature, demonstrates happiness in serenity,
                and teaches kindness. It thoughtfully explores many mature
                themes, including sexism, revenge, destiny, genocide, systemic
                discrimination, spiritualism, loss, honor, abusive
                relationships, and the tragedies of warâ€”themes that its pre-teen
                audience are likely underexposed to. The most central theme is
                arguably the nuances of good and evil and the complexity of
                villainy, and it delves into this dark subject while balancing
                the needs of its young and impressionable audience. It does all
                this without being in-your-face, "here's the lesson" about it,
                and remembers that at its heart, it's still a children's
                cartoon.

                Well, I'm actually not here to tell you about ATLA. I'm actually

                TLoK is a sequel series that follows 17-year-old Korra, the
                Avatar after Aang, as she completes her bending training and
                learns to be the guardian of peace and justice{" "}

                in a rapidly changing, increasingly connected, industrializing
                world. Korra's adventures are centered around Republic City, an
                urbanized metropolis that was formed when a Fire Nation colony
                in the Earth Kingdom transitioned to be independent of the four
                nations. Unlike Aang, Korra starts out feisty, combative, and
                eager to fulfill her duties as the Avatar, and yet, unlike ATLA,
                TLoK doesn't have a single overarching conflictâ€”an outlet for
                her "Avatar duties"â€”to connect the entire series.

            <br />
            <p>
                TLoK differs from ATLA in many more ways; the industrialization
                and urbanization of TLoK strips away the love for nature and
                ideas of spiritualism that ATLA emphasized

                            This isn't purely in vainâ€”in many ways, TLoK
                            contrasts starkly with ATLA{" "}
                            <strong>by design</strong>. The rapidly-urbanized
                            world of TLoK is meant to signal Korra's duty; Aang
                            was a calm spiritual leader when the world needed an
                            authoritative, powerful bender, Korra was a powerful
                            bender when the world needed the Avatar's guidance.

                . Possibly in an attempt to balance the previous point and add
                to the lore, TLoK over-explains the mechanics and origins of the
                Avatar and the Spirit World, which douses the embers of mystery
                and fantasy that ATLA worked so hard to sow. TLoK also seemingly
                succumbs to patting itself on the back for how awesome their
                world is, and how cool fighting while using the elements would
                be. Bending is no longer a sacred art; it is a collectible that
                merits a "woahhh, sweet!" The show also essentially poses the
                rhetorical question, "How sick would it be to be the Avatar?!?"
                This is clear as glass in this flashback, in which a pre-K Korra
                is shown proudly displaying her bending prowess, exclaiming,{" "}

            <br />
            <p>
                Before the series had even settled, and in less than two
                minutes, TLoK tore down the humility and restraint that ATLA
                championed, and understandably, audiences were not fans of the
                show. Don't believe me?
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>https://youtu.be/bmKaQqinWKY?t=125 (watch till 2:40)</p>
            <br />
            TLoK is riddled with many more issues. It introduced far too many
            characters too quickly, which prevented the show from properly
            establishing and developing any of them. ATLA was blessed with 61
            episodes and had 12 core characters, while TLoK used its 52 episodes
            to distribute screen-time and dialogue over 22â€”nearly twice as many.
            On top of that, since TLoK didn't have one central conflict; it
            needed to introduce, develop, and resolve new antagonists in{" "}
            <strong>each</strong> of its four seasons, which came at the expense
            of time for its protagonists. The result is a hodgepodge of rushed
            relationships, a reliance on tropes to substitute for individuality,
            unclear motivations, and generally weak characters.
            <p>
                However, I argue that much of the blame for TLoK's mediocrity
                falls on the network, and not the writers. Despite ATLA, one of
                the most successful and acclaimed shows in Nickelodeon's
                history, TLoK was originally only granted one season of only 13
                episodes. Then, after a reasonably successful first season, at
                least as far as Nickelodeon's standards go, TLoK was bequeathed
                a season two. By the end of season two, the fandom had
                more-or-less settled on the show being painfully below-average,
                so Nickelodeon permitted two more online-only seasons to cash-in
                and wrap up what the showrunners had started.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                But blaming Nickelodeon doesn't absolve TLoK of its glaring
                issues. Maybe it explains most of them, sure, but that doesn't
                suddenly make TLoK good. That would be akin to arguing that the
                dick sandwich I made last week was good because all I had in my
                pantry was bread, ketchup, and dick.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                So why on earth would I, a bona fide asshole when it comes to
                art criticism, defend this clusterfuck? Yes, I know the
                vulgarity is sudden and a bit much.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                The short answer is that I love TLoK because Korra's development
                in seasons three and four is so genuine and revolutionary that I
                have to defend it. After the writers' authenticity and
                capabilities were put into serious question, they came back and
                showed us true art once more. Let me set the scene...though for
                brevity and to avoid spoiling too much, you should know that I'm
                only going to talk about season three.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                By the start of season three, Korra's influence on not just
                Republic City, but the world, has grown tremendously. In the
                previous season, she created a physical gateway in the middle of
                Republic City that connected the spirit world to the physical
                world, which opened up a whole new can of beetleworms

                for regular people and benders alike. Conflict in season three
                arises when a group of four extremists break out of prison.
                These extremists are led by Zaheer, a staunch anarchist, whose
                aim is to end the Avatar entirelyâ€”he plans to kill Korra while
                she's in the Avatar state, so that the reincarnation cycle ends.{" "}

            <br />
            <p>
                Zaheer proves to be an incredibly difficult villain for Korra.
                His stoic charisma is chilling when juxtaposed with his extreme
                views, and his dedication to his cause is unmatched in the
                seriesâ€”you get the sense that he's ready to give up everything
                for "true freedom."
            </p>
            <br />" When we dispatch you in the Avatar State, the cycle will
            end. So we lucky few, this band of brothers and sisters in anarchy,
            are witnessing the beginning of an era of true freedom. Together, we
            will forge a world without Kings and Queensâ€”without borders or
            nations. Where Man's only allegiance is to himself, and those he
            loves. We will return to the true balance...of natural order. And
            though you will never again be reborn, your name will echo
            throughout history: Korra, the last Avatar.
            <p>&ndash;;Zaheer, to Korra</p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Zaheer's whole schtick is essentially that anarchism is the only
                system that enables true freedom, and that the existence of the
                Avatar, a practically all-powerful authority figure who answers
                to no one, is anything but compatible with that. In other words,
                Zaheer is similar to the average TLoK criticâ€”he takes issue with
                pre-K Korra's "I'm the Avatar! You gotta deal with it!"
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Zaheer is a perfect foil to Korra, tooâ€”though Korra excelled at
                the combative nature of being the Avatar, she toiled mightily
                with the spiritual aspects, while Zaheer is so capable that he's
                able to enter the spirit world through meditation alone. Zaheer
                is also disciplined and mostly expressionless, whereas Korra has
                been smiley and energetic since season 1, episode 1.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Throughout season three, Zaheer's efforts torment Korra. At one
                point, Zaheer and his group have Korra in chains as they try to
                torture and kill her. To end season three, Korra and her allies
                fight Zaheer as he continues to attempt to end the Avatar cycle.
                Zaheer's resolve is nearly impossible to overcome, though, and
                it almost feels like the show might actually conclude with
                Korra's death. The battle ends with Aang's granddaughter,
                Jinora, and Korra narrowly capturing Zaheer, though not without
                lossâ€”for the duration of the battle, Korra was poisoned with
                mercury, which led to paralysis in her legs.{" "}

                After Zaheer's capture, Korra is unable to walk, which in many
                respects, is a win for Zaheerâ€”at least one lifetime of the
                Avatar is wasted. We see Korra, who was so excited and eager to
                be a great Avatar since the day we met her, defeated. A once
                annoyingly-cheerful girl is completely broken, and reduced to
                hard depression.

                Season three concludes with a ceremony honoring Jinora's
                air-bending masteryâ€”she sure demonstrated it when she captured
                Zaheer. Because of Korra's new shortcomings, the Air Nomads, led
                by Aang's son and Jinora, vow to fill Korra's role and ensure
                balance and peace in the world, practically acknowledging that
                Korra won't be able to "be" the Avatar. And as Jinora reveals
                her shaved head and new arrow tattoos, bearing an uncanny
                resemblance to Aang, Korra is reminded of how loved and
                successful her predecessor was, and that comparatively, she's a
                failure, both in her world and in ours.{" "}

                Korra's story in season three resonates with me in a way that I
                couldn't previously fathomâ€”Korra's mannerisms and attitude were
                incredibly irritating in seasons one and two, but once those
                were taken away and replaced with devastation, their value
                became clear, and I felt guilt for ever chastising her joy. The
                beauty of the season extends even beyond Korra's growth. I
                almost feel as if the writers were trying to tell us that they
                were head-over-heels excited for TLoK, but comparisons to their
                perfect previous show turned that excitement into a silent
                sorrow.

                The writers turned a bad couple seasons into a purposeful
                experience, and now that I've seen season three, I can't look
                back at seasons one and two with the same overly-critical eye.
                The writers' ability to express these emotions and evoke so much
                from me are why I will never tolerate uncontextualized slander
                for ATLA's beautiful, unloved sister, The Legend of Korra.
